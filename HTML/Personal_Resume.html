			Sir:<br />
			<br />
			I've been reading about your company online, and it seemed substantial too, though it would be such a shame if your company goes into the hand of someone who could not appreciate it. Perhaps you could consider hiring me, and I guarantee that I would be suitable for your company.<br /><br />
			The future is rather ominous, for it's something I nor anyone know its true certainty, but immaterial it is, for it was just a deriving us more, to the curiosity of reality. I predict it would be something like being in a position in your company. My passion is creating and making new things, and my goal is to create a better future.<br /><br />
			I could do evidentiary things for your company. In addition to being creative, I also maintain things, operate well skillfully with speed, and support while having a positive impression, and I may be an independent worker, but I need to be collaborative to survive.<br /><br />
			I might like to thank you and appreciate your consideration. I'm looking forward to an opportunity to be interviewed and talk about my position whenever you are available and be able to work for your company. For more information, contact me at (contacts) or visit my website portfolio at (HTTPS).<br /> <br /><br />
