            I was in tenth grade when our school started teaching HTML. Since I found it fascinating that I could create any website, including the ones I used, I learned the fundamentals and recreated the offline version of Facebook using only HTML, based on the mobile web version. I arguably manage to be the best of them since they can't even build a successful network and settle on a template for a page.
